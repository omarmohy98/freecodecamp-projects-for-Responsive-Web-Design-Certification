                        At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to
                        pieces
                        of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list?
                        Is
                        it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three
                        columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a
                        page.
                        This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax
                        you
                        need to know to understand HTML.

                        Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at
                        least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at
                        it
                        and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in
                        Installing
                        basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with
                        files).
                        Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

                        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that
                        tells
                        web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as
                        the
                        web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose,
                        wrap,
                        or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing
                        tags
                        can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For
                        example, consider the following line of text:
                        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing
                        it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element" class="main-section">
                <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
                <div class="m">
                    <p>
                        Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:
                    </p>

                        alt="Anatomy of html elements">
                    <p>The anatomy of our element is:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>The opening tag:</span> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p
                            for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where
                            the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the
                            paragraph text.</li>
                        <li><span>The content:</span> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the
                            paragraph text.</li>
                        <li><span>The closing tag:</span> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                            forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include
                            a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.
                    </p>

                        Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual
                        elements combine to form an entire HTMLpage:
                        <code
                            class="codespiacal">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                        Here we have:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>:
                            The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set
                            of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. Doctypes used to look
                            something like this:
                            <code>
                                &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
                                "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
                            </code>
                            More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything
                            else to work right.<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> is the shortest string of characters
                            that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!
                        </li>
                        <li><span>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>: The <span>&lt;html&gt;</span> element. This element
                            wraps all the content
                            on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                        <li>
                            <span>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>:
                            The &lt;head&gt;element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include
                            on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes
                            keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content,
                            character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article of
                            the series.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span>:
                            This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most
                            characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page
                            can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and
                            it can help avoid some problems later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>:
                            The &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears
                            in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page
                            when it is bookmarked.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span>:
                            The &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including
                            text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making
                        comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the
                        code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after
                        being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are
                        invaluable as different people are making changes and updates. <br><br>

                        To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers <span>&lt;!-- and --&gt;</span>.

                        The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page
                        is loaded. It contains information such as the page <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>, links to CSS (if
                        you choose to
                        style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about
                        the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that describe the document.) In this
                        article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order to give you a good basis for working
                        with markup.

                    <p>
                        Let's revisit the simple <a href="#Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document">HTML document we covered in the
                            previous article:</a>
                        <code
                            class="codespiacal">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;p&gt;This is my page&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
                        The HTML head is the contents of the
                        <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> element — unlike the contents of the
                        <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser),
                        the head's content is
                        not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the
                        document. In the above example, the head is quite small:
                        <code class="codespiacal">&lt;head&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&#9;&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;
                        </code>
                        In larger pages however, the head can get quite full. Try going to some of your favorite
                        websites and use the developer tools to check out their head contents. Our aim here is not to
                        show you how to use everything that can possibly be put in the head, but rather to teach you how
                        to use the major elements that you'll want to include in the head, and give you some
                        familiarity. Let's get started.

                        We've already seen the <span>&lt;title&gt;</span> element in action — this can be used to add a

                        to add a top
                        level heading to your body content — this is also sometimes referred to as the page

                            element appears on the page when loaded in the browser — generally this should be used once
                            per page, to mark up the title of your page content (the story title, or news headline, or
                            whatever is appropriate to your usage.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The
                            <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>
                            element is metadata that represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the
                            document's content.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="Metadata_the_meta_element" class="main-section">
                <header>Metadata the meta element</header>

                    <p>
                        Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a
                        document — the
                        <span>&lt;meta&gt;</span> element. Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this
                        article could also be
                        thought of as metadata too. There are a lot of different types of
                        <span>&lt;meta&gt;</span> elements that can be included in your page's

                        <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>, but we won't try to explain them all at this stage, as it would just
                        get too confusing.
                        Instead, we'll explain a few things that you might commonly see, just to give you an idea.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="Adding_custom_icons_to_your_site" class="main-section">
                <header>Adding custom icons to your site</header>
                <div class="m">
                    <p>
                        To further enrich your site design, you can add references to custom icons in your metadata, and
                        these will be displayed in certain contexts. The most commonly used of these is the favicon
                        (short for "favorites icon", referring to its use in the "favorites" or "bookmarks" lists in
                        browsers). <br> <br>

                        The humble favicon has been around for many years. It is the first icon of this type: a 16-pixel
                        square icon used in multiple places. You may see (depending on the browser) favicons displayed
                        in the browser tab containing each open page, and next to bookmarked pages in the bookmarks
                        panel.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section id="Setting_the_primary_language_of_the_document" class="main-section">
                <header>Setting the primary language of the document</header>
                <div class="m">
                    <p>
                        Finally, it's worth mentioning that you can (and really should) set the language of your page.
                        This can be done by adding the lang attribute to the opening HTML tag (as seen in the
                        meta-example.html and shown below.)
                        <code>
                            &lt;html lang="en-US" &gt;
                        </code>
                        This is useful in many ways. Your HTML document will be indexed more effectively by search
                        engines if its language is set (allowing it to appear correctly in language-specific results,
                        for example), and it is useful to people with visual impairments using screen readers (for
                        example, the word "six" exists in both French and English, but is pronounced differently.)
