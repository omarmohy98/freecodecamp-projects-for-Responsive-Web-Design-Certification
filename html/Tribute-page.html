            <h2>Here's the history of User Story:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>1998:</span> Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the
                    phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>1999:</span> Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained,
                    introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2001:</span>
                    Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation: The Card (or often a post-it
                    note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts.
                    The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.).
                    It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation.
                    The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2001:</span> The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and shared
                    examples with others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2004:</span> Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in
                    his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard
                    reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of
                    user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a
                    whole with the invention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2014:</span> After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton
                    published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the
                    identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their
                    interdependence.
